## Essex-CE888
This repository stores work done for CE888-Data Science &amp; Decision Making module.

## Dependency
* Python 2.7.14 :: Anaconda custom (64-bit)

* Pandas 1.4.1

* matplotlib: 2.1.0

## Folder Structure

* assignment1-seq2seq - contains the jupyter notebook for the sequence2sequence translation assignment. 
For the work [Spider dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08887) is used. 
As part of the initial analysis the notebook contains details of exploratory data analysis done on the dataset.

* Assignment-2 - contains the jupyter notebook for the sequence2sequence translation assignment 2. The notebook has the entire code which includes data preprocessing, simulation of different models. I understand that in the assignment we were asked to provide a python script instead and use jupyter notebook only for data illustrations but due to paucity of time I couldnâ€™t convert the code into a python script. Pardon me for that. 
 
* Dataset - contains JSON files used as input for training and testing the model
